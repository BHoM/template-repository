This repository can be used to create brand new BHoM Toolkits :rocket:

In order to use it:
- Use this template repository to create your own repository. Call it with the name of your software, like "SoftwareName_Toolkit".
- In your new repository, double click the `RenameAll.bat` file. When asked, insert the name of your software, e.g. "Robot". All the files and folder will be renamed accordingly.
- Start developing! :rocket:
